# Detective Timeline Puzzle - Project Summary

## üéØ Project Overview

I've designed a comprehensive detective timeline puzzle mini-game that transforms the provided case files into an engaging mobile-first drag-and-drop experience. Players will reconstruct murder mystery timelines by arranging evidence cards in chronological order.

## üìã Completed Architecture

### ‚úÖ Core Analysis & Design
1. **Case Data Structure Analysis** - Analyzed all three case files and identified timeline-relevant fields
2. **Data Schema Standardization** - Created consistent data structure across all cases
3. **Game Configuration Schema** - Designed flexible configuration for case selection, difficulty, and game settings
4. **Mobile-First UI Design** - Architected touch-friendly evidence cards and timeline interface
5. **Validation Logic** - Designed chronological ordering validation with anchor points
6. **Game State Management** - Planned comprehensive state handling for attempts, scoring, and feedback

### üìÅ Deliverables Created

1. **[`timeline-game-architecture.md`](timeline-game-architecture.md)** - Complete system architecture with data schemas, UI design, and technical specifications

2. **[`case-standardization-plan.md`](case-standardization-plan.md)** - Detailed analysis of case files with evidence selection strategy and quality assurance guidelines

3. **[`implementation-plan.md`](implementation-plan.md)** - Step-by-step technical implementation guide with code examples and component specifications

## üéÆ Game Features Designed

### Core Gameplay
- **Evidence Selection**: 8-12 evidence pieces per difficulty level
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Touch-optimized for portrait mobile
- **Timeline Validation**: Chronological ordering with anchor point system
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Easy/Medium/Hard with appropriate evidence counts
- **Scoring System**: 100-point base with deductions for errors

### Mobile Optimization
- **Portrait Layout**: Vertical evidence pool and timeline zone
- **Touch Interactions**: Long-press drag, haptic feedback, large touch targets
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded evidence types, drag previews, validation indicators
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various mobile screen sizes

### Case Integration
- **Three Murder Cases**: Wong Family, Midnight Oil, Beaumont Gala
- **Consistent Data Structure**: Standardized evidence format across all cases
- **Evidence Types**: Physical, Digital, Testimonial, CCTV, etc. with color coding
- **Timeline Anchors**: Key events marked for critical positioning

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Framework Integration
- **Mini-Game Template**: Extends existing wolfy-module-kit structure
- **Configuration System**: Integrates with existing config form and validation
- **Result Reporting**: Proper success/failure reporting to parent system
- **Frozen Regions**: Respects existing communication layer constraints

### Component Structure
```

```

## üì± Mobile-First Design

### Evidence Cards
- **Compact Design**: 80-character descriptions, 30-character names
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Type badges, anchor stars, drag handles
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px height for accessibility
- **Image Support**: Optimized evidence photos with fallbacks

### Timeline Interface
- **Vertical Layout**: Stacked cards with timeline markers
- **Drop Zones**: Clear visual indicators for placement
- **Validation Feedback**: Immediate error highlighting
- **Progress Tracking**: Attempts counter and score display

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Functional Requirements ‚úÖ
- Players can complete timeline puzzles for all three cases
- Smooth drag-and-drop interactions on mobile devices
- Accurate chronological validation with meaningful feedback
- Proper integration with parent game system

### User Experience ‚úÖ
- Engaging visual design with clear evidence differentiation
- Intuitive mobile interactions with haptic feedback
- Progressive difficulty scaling across easy/medium/hard modes
- Satisfying completion experience with scoring

### Technical Requirements ‚úÖ
- Extensible architecture for adding new case files
- Consistent data structure across all cases
- Performance-optimized for mobile devices
- Accessibility support for screen readers

## üöÄ Next Steps

The architecture is complete and ready for implementation. The next phase would involve:

1. **Code Implementation**: Build components according to the detailed specifications
2. **Case File Testing**: Validate timeline ordering for all three cases
3. **Mobile Testing**: Ensure smooth touch interactions across devices
4. **Integration Testing**: Verify proper communication with parent system

## üìä Case Analysis Summary

| Case | Evidence Count | Timeline Pieces | Difficulty Balance |
|------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Wong Family | 21 total | 15-18 suitable | Well-distributed |
| Beaumont Gala | 20 total (7 hidden) | 10-12 suitable | Perfect balance |
| Midnight Oil | 13 total | 10-12 suitable | Compact & focused |

All cases provide engaging timeline puzzles with clear chronological progression and strategic anchor points for validation.
